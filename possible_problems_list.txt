ways that counterfactual explanations won't make sense:
  x doesnt match x**2
  "if your marital status wasnt NaN, we would have approved"
  "300 sqft and 5 bedrooms"
  multiclass dummy variables: "if your "location_kowloon" was 0 instead of 1 we would have approved". also depends on whether we use drop_first in get_dummies().
    a related thing is that, with multiclass dummies, chaning the class is actually changing 2 variables.

how do we handle boolean features when normalizing?
